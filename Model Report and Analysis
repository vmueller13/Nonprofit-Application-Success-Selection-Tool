# Alphabet Soup Charity Report #

## Overview ##

The purpose of this analysis is to use the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Results ## 

### Data Preprocessing ###

* Target variables for the model are `IS_SUCCESSFUL`
* What variable(s) are the features for your model?`STATUS	ASK_AMT		AFFILIATION	APPLICATION_TYPE	CLASSIFICATION	INCOME_AMT	ORGANIZATION	SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS	USE_CASE`
* `EIN` and `NAME` were removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model ###

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.
